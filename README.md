## Usage Notes

This module requires a secret to be present in the key vault in order to execute successfully. Since the vault is created by this project itself, the first such attempt is guaranteed to fail. To set up a new environment then:

1. Execute the project.
   * The key vault and application insights resources will be created.
   * The bulk print fail action group and associated alert will fail.
   * The PDF fail action group and associated alert will fail.
   * The ff4j admissions failure action group and associated alert will fail.
2. Manually add the `bulk-print-failure-email` secret with a single email address; this is where alerts about bulk print failures will be sent.
3. Manually add the `pdf-failure-email` secret with a single email address; this is where alerts about PDF failures will be sent.
4. Manually add the `ff4j-admissions-failure-email` secret with a single email address; this is where alerts about ff4j admissions failure will be sent.


5. Execute the project again.
   * The key vault and application insights resources already exist and will be skipped.
   * The bulk print fail action group and associated alert will be successfully defined.
   * The PDF fail action group and associated alert will be successfully defined.
   * The ff4j admissions failure action group and associated alert will be successfully defined.
